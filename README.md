Selecting "New Game" will begin a new game. Players enter how many people are playing, and optionally, their names. Then, the app brings them to the drawing interface screen to begin play.

On this screen, the current player draws the section of the body indicated in the title. Different colors and brush width can be selected on the top of the screen. The players can choose whether to set a time limit on their drawing in the settings. In this screenshot, an infinite amount of time is given to draw.

Once all the players have drawn their section, the result is revealed. This resulting picture can be deleted or saved in the gallery. If players entered their names at the beginning of the game, their names are saved with the pictures they created, and the gallery can be searched to show all images contributed to by a certain player.
